Woah, hello, I haven't written blogs in a while. I want to start with definitions first, I am a straight trans girl. That means that I am attracted to men and I identify as a woman... that also means I am horribly boring. I am not ashamed of being trans, yet it feels kinda like me being right-handed. It's just something I *happened* to be. I wanna kinda write down about how I feel about it throughout the ages. I thought it'd be kinda neat to write it down somewhere. 

## "Prologue"

I guess it's worth mentioning the prologue? Before everything began. I never wanted to be a guy, I always hated the idea. The secondary sex characteristic that *I* apparently will develop disgusted my young self to no end. I remembered when I often say that I am an amoeba and that I have no gender or sex. I don't know... it brings me comfort, even false ones, that it won't happen to me. I have heard of trans people before, but the surgery (what I thought to be requirements) kinda scare 8 years old me. As for attraction to men, I just assumed it was "bros before hoes" kinda vibe y'know. The information I had at the time, also kinda implied it's mentally ill people and *no way am I not-okay in the head amirite*. Honestly, I never really cared about it beyond that, it's my childhood! I also had puberty at like 15 or something (my dad also has a slow puberty, so maybe I got it from him), the dysphoria hadn't really set in hard yet (though I was insecure about having short hair because it makes my ears look like the elephant from dumbo).

## First encounter

If you've seen my [previous blog post](https://www.atiusamy.com/reflection/) before, then sit back because this ain't the best thing. To TLDR that, I was in a very bad place at a very bad time. COVID happened and I was stuck indoors, I can't stay alone. I was in a particularly bigoted community at the time and it rubbed off on me. I was not a very good person, I even harassed some people (that I later retroactively apologized for, I still feel guilty). I originally thought that they were weird people, even if I could relate, I was more like "Yeah, I can deal with it, why can't you" *without yet experiencing the horror that is the wrong puberty*. I think this was the low point in my life. Slowly I started to be more accepting of everything and questioning myself. 

## The Questioning Phase

Alright, this was back in 2021. Ironically, after I already adopted the name "Amy" online for a "joke". I wouldn't call me of this period nice, but it's at least an improvement. At the time I called myself bi (specifically biromantic asexual), because I didn't want to say I'm a gay guy or a straight girl (The only "crush" I had on a girl was because I thought boys and girls can't be friends forever, but when she said no I practically felt nothing, and also it was online in the other half of the world so....), so I just went with bi because for every gender it's always going to say bi. If I can find an old Twitter bio of mine, I'll put it here

Oh! This is also where "AmyIsCoolz" comes from. A pretty neat lil username. I wasn't really into egg culture at the time, so this was pretty boring. I just kinda left myself in an ambiguous state and I even seemed rude because I won't use either Krub or Ka in Thai. To be clear, I knew I had gender dysphoria at that point, I just never labeled myself trans because I felt like I wasn't trans enough (lol, lmao (tbf I heard that you don't necessarily need gender dysphoria to be transgender, but I feel like if you do have it, you probably are)). I slowly just kinda "transition into being trans"(?) if that makes sense, there is no "day when I realized" it just kinda happened. 

## Coming out

Okay, so eventually I had to do that. I did it online first, it was kinda easy as I always left it ambiguous, so it was like "you didn't know??????" even though there is no reason they would with my ambiguousness. As for IRL, it was more difficult. I just started easy by telling my parents that I'm "questioning" and then do acting like I don't already know the answer. As for classmates.... I never had enough courage to be able to do that. I wrote in my previous blog post about how terrible my high school period was, I was shy and socially anxious. No way that's happening. All I did was keep my hair at maximum length, but that doesn't exactly say anything on its own. Eventually, I just kinda do a 'switch' when I went to university. Just started going by "Amy" and that's it! All the trouble should be behind me now, if there's people I know from the past I'd just say "Oh, we have a lot of catch up on". A lot less stressful that way. 

## Experiences in real life

Honestly, nothing bad to report here. I have a lot of friends I can talk to, and they are very nice to me (If some of my friends are reading this, from the bottom of my heart, thank you very much). I never experienced transphobia aside from a random taxi driver asking if I'm a guy or a girl, but he looked more genuinely confused than anything (ughhh I need to do voice training). There are some rough edges and everything is not perfect by any means, but it went a lot better than I thought. I even found a couple of enbies IRL, super cool! Worth noting that I live in Thailand, while it is not the most supportive country (No title change and most people are surprised to learn that gay men and trans women are different thing), there isn't a total moral panic like there is in certain red states (I'd prefer to not talk too much about politics here, I am a human being, not a political debate subject), I believe the story would be very different if that were the case.

## Experiences online

This was a mixed bag. I already cut off a lot of connections with terrible people during my questioning phase, so that's all done and dusted. I used to have a Twitter account that I don't put a trans pride flag emoji in my name because I fear harassment. In my inner-circle in paleotwt and jwtwt at the time, I never got a negative reaction upon finding out that I'm not cis. Honestly, that's all I cared about. One day, Twitter was bought by Elon and I decided to deactivate my account because I have no interest in being on a platform ran by incompetent people (well, I am on my own blog, and I am pretty incompetent, so that might be an issue /j). I hopped on the Fediverse and while Mastodon was generally boring American politics, many Fediverse instances seemed to be interested in more than just mainstream American politics, it's almost like they have a personality. Unfortunately, this was a mixed bag. See, most of my friends remain on Twitter and this was basically me venturing out in the "internet wilderness" (Funnily, I was going to make a Fediverse comic based on that exact same concept). I picked up some people in my follow list, though the feed was still relatively boring. Until tumblr imploded in on itself with the recent transphobic drama. Many people from there moved on to transfem.social. I decided to try to make friend with those people.... and it went terribly, these subculture of tumblr and the existing transfem culture within the Fediverse interweave together seamlessly. The only ones that don't interweave nicely is..... me. See, these people have almost one identity it's difficult to tell one from another, if I say "Sapphic transfem who owns a blahaj, likes computer and tech, likes trains, is 'quirky'" I would still haven't narrowed down much (They also kinda just have the same opinion relating to Fedi Drama about a toxic transfem and a black person, but I really don't wanna get into that). Honestly, this was very isolating, I feel very disconnected, had I not have friends in real life at the time things would've gone much worse (and generally I was mostly on Fedi during holidays, and it makes holidays feel terrible). I mean, there are people who are transfem, pride themselves in being one, making jokes about it... that I completely not relate to and the constant "haha there's no straight people on fedi" or "I can't comprehend straight love" really rubbed me off the wrong way. 

*(I was going to include some images that makes me feel really bad here, but I can't find the reply I made about it, so it shall remain forgotten)*

I am not the target sure, they're probably talking about cishets, but man does it hurt. Especially the "no straight people here" part, I don't like when people say I'm a confused gay guy or whatever, it doesn't feel nice. This isn't their intentions, but I just don't feel like being here anymore. Having a trans flag in my bio also give me like vulnerabilities in being flirted by other transfem. **PLEASE DO NOT FLIRT WITH ME IN A SEXUAL WAY, ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU DON'T KNOW ME**. I haven't found a good trans community since then and I don't think I will continue looking, I'll be in whichever community that makes me feel the most accepted and shares my interests, that place is not and probably will never be the Fediverse.

## Conclusion

Well, the last one was a bit long and I apologize for that. I am very happy about my social situation as it stands. I am active in like one discord community in terms of online (Check out [GuiLi Garden](https://discord.gg/AVMgRfBRgn), it's a Discord server based on my favorite Genshin ship!). In real life, I also have a lot of friends, and I don't feel like me being trans made them treat me any lesser than they would a cis person. While there are a lot of rough roads when in comes to coming out or online community. I'm very glad to be past all that and can at least be proud of what I've been through and the fact that I persevered despite everything. So, would I rather be trans or cis? The answer should be obvious after this rambling I've been through..... The answer is cis muhahaha, what a plot twist. Being trans is integral to myself in many ways and I would be different if I wasn't trans, but I would gladly give all of that up for a clearer social standing, more self-confidence (no questioning acceptance and stuff), and an easier life that I don't need to take pills every day. If you feel any different, feel free to do the thought exercise for yourself and if you wanna talk to me about it, you can find my contacts [here](https://www.atiusamy.com/links/). Alright, back to reading Organic Chemistry.

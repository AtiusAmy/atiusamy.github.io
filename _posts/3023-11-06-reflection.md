2023 what a year!- welll it has not ended yet.... but it should be in a month, so it's time to reflect on it, but first we need to recap

### Recap

Let's recap my situation and who I am. Unless you're not aware (Can't blame you, you might be from YouTube) I'm Amy! Now, before 2020, I have a very clear personality. I try to be nice and supportive to many people as possible, however I have an occasional prankster side which I try to suppress. It does occasinally show out from time to time, before "Atius" I used to be known as "BLUEBB_333". Back then all the social media I had was YouTube channel and that's it. I did troll someone once with my cousin in the comment section of a YouTube reply, there was one infamous "thread" let's call it, under Zajcu37's video. It was not the most pretty thing I did. A while later when I was playing Roblox, that side of me shows up once again. This might be one of my biggest mistake that lead me down a worse path. In the summer of 2018, I had a friend. We were playing Phantom Forces and I decided to votekick him for fun, because it's acting up again. This one event made my friend pretty mad, he blocked me and left the school that year (Whether he left the school because of me or not is irrelevant, because that's what I was feeling atm), I was pretty heartbroken. I was not one to confront my own feeling of guilt however, the best thing I did was try to suppress it and burn everything that reminded me of that era. I left Roblox, I decided "Y'know what? Fine! I'll do my own thing" I got a little group playing lego'es. One of them was quite a history nerd, talking about stuff I could never understand, I had to get my mind off of Roblox so I decided to read more about it. I watched a bunch of "OverSimplified" History videos about WW2, and this is when things started to change. It was Grade 6 and while that year was generally relatively fun, it was quite bittersweet.

In Thailand, once you stop Grade 6 (Prathom), you move on to Matthayom. I move on to Matthayom 1 naturally. I (my parents) decided to go to CRU, which is the province's "number 1" public school. (It was actually segregated between AMAB and AFAB people). Of course, I studied and make sure I can pass the entrance exam to get in. I did not get into the Gifted class (Thank god for that). I actually got into the "King" class which is like the most top "normal" one. I was pretty proud of myself actually, but when I'm not doing anything, I am starting to have nothing to do. I didn't go to my grandparent's house to play Minecraft and hang out with my cousins like usual, because well, I had an entrance exam to do. My little brother had been sent off over there to not disturb me. This puts me in a very weird and uncomfortable position, I am an extroverted person. Talking to people is like my whole thing.

Real life stuff out of the way, let's jump back a bit to late 6th grade, I discovered these things called "Countryballs". They're like Country but balls and they talk, abd a while later, I discovered something called "[Alternate Future of the World](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLM8MOe2tQUyMUxch65t0m5kzljmJYH8NA)" by Cosmic Mapping, I binged all of the episode. In an alternate universe, this would just have been a passing video, nothing more nothing less. A few days later, the YouTube algorithm decided to serve me [videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLYZO2Y_ZXiKiYy1ilgbVGsKK1wKy90oiv) from Japanese Mapping. It combined the concept of "AFOW" and "Countryballs" together and it was fairly 'well-produced'.

I decided to make my own because I wanted to make my own, it was okay-ish for a first video, but good enough to attract some attention by a few other 'mappers'. Two of the people that commented on my videos are "Sebileanow" and "Hyperflame", they later launched a Discord server together (I had to recovered my Discord account for this lol). I had moved to a new school so after a whi

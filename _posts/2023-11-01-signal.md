Ever since I was a kid, I've always hated the choice of messaging software. I used to use LINE which is a messaging service popular here in Thailand and Japan. I never liked it, the other choice I could use are: SMS and Facebook Messenger, which I don't think I need to explain why they are horrible. :P

### But how have I heard of Signal though?

![runarcn](/images/runarcn.png)

A few months ago, [@runarcn](https://mstdn.social/@runarcn) introduced me to Signal and recommended it. I don't usually agree on everything runarcn said... actually I don't agree with most things he usually talks about (sorry runarcn :P). I have tried out private options before, such as Matrix or Telegram. I feel like they are kinda horrible in their own right. Matrix for example is not the most user-friendly, plus their uh- "Failed to decrypt" issue is something I'd never want to bring to my friends or family. As for Telegram, it's not the worst but the fact that their server-side code is not FOSS makes it something I want to touch less compared to Signal. Proprietary software is not like that much of an issue for me, but if I could choose I'd choose FOSS  ones. (Provided it is good enough)

### The Good

So when I first downloaded Signal on my phone there are two things I noticed: 
1. This is very user-friendly!
2. Holy cow! It actually looks good! 
That's my first impression, but there's more to i than that, there's desktop Linux support! Hooray! If you've seen my [last article](https://atiusamy.github.io/switched-to-linux/) that was kind of an issue for me... I like that it added features that typical user would expect such as: Stickers, GIF, Voice Message, Stories, and Video calls! While I don't use half of those features myself, I think it's nice for those switching from other platforms which do have that.

### The Lovely

I was gonna do a "The Good, The Bad, The Ugly" kinda style because I thought it's funny but I don't have anything that I'd call bad or even ugly, sooooo yeah :P Anyways, one of the things I love about Signal is their stance on encryption, [Signal even threatens to pull out of the UK](https://cybernews.com/news/signal-to-leave-uk/) because their government wants them to break the encryption and scan for media that user may send, that is really good dedication to user-privacy. In a [recent interview](https://restofworld.org/2023/signal-president-meredith-whittaker-messaing-privacy/) Signal's President, Meredith Whittaker have been asked about the topic: **How do you respond to the government pressure to comply when you’re threatened with an outright ban?** "I mean, it’s simple: We can’t provide the information. So you can put a gun to my head — you’ll have to shoot. We don’t have it because it’s end-to-end encrypted. There’s no balancing that’s in our hands because of the guarantees we make." I doubt that I will need that kind of privacy and security anytime soon, but it's a very nice to have in this day and age. Another nice thing that I really love is the foundation behind it. It is a non-profit, which is really nice considering that their goals isn't to make money of my data....

### The Annoyance

Like everything in this world, it isn't perfect. Here are a few annoyances I have with it: 
1. No Android tablets support: This isn't an issue I'd particularly blame Signal for as Android tablets have like barely any market share... *This can be fixed using a fork of Signal Android called [Molly](https://molly.im/)*
2. No usernames: This is kind of an issue if I ever want to use it for online purporses. Signal is originally made to be an SMS replacement, so they haven't switched over to username instead of phone number. I hope something does happen in the end though.
3. No SMS support: Well, they used to but not anymore :( This is mostly just so I can read SMS on the desktop....
4. The protocol is not federate: This may change, and I think it will with the new EU law, so fingercrossed?

## In Conclusion

I really love Signal so far, and I think it is my favorite messaging app to date. I very much recommend Signal to everyone.... if you're comfortable revealing your phone number (for now), but it should not be a problem for IRL stuff, so anyway: Use Signal and stay encrypted! Amy out!

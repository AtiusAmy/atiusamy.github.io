  <details>
    <summary>Can you speak less?</summary>
    <p>
      Yes... but speaking distracts me from having my brain doubting and assaulting me with mean words :( I'm sorry I spoke too much!

  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>Your last question doesn't add up, you seem very silent.</summary>
    <p>
      If so, I am either shy or zoning out. Just call (call as in say my name) me and I should response. If I do zone out however, please actually let me know I am not doing anything instead of keeping it to yourself and thinking I would get your cues (I wouldn't because I am zoning out like bruh).
    </p>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>Why are you an atheist?</summary>
    <p>
      I just can't believe in religion, though I can't say I have anything against it (Aside from Theocracy which I think is different from just plain relgiion).
      I come from a religious minority here in Thailand (Catholic in a Buddhist Country), and it was brought communities together so I can't say it's entirely bad.
